# hello-world
This is not just another repository.

I am towards completion all that I begin, and always begin.
So I commit to begining, and ending. By that commitment I will see it through.

Through all that is, and all that can be in my way, and all that I put in my way, and even myself if necessary (mostly necessary).

Please branch and add. You are free.
